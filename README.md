## 0.1 Intent
This project is an exploratory analysis of data about youtube channels. I will be using Python packages pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and seaborn to manipulate data and create visuals. This project will focus on channel start years, features of top channels, variable correlations, and categorical analysis. The dataset can be found on Kaggle [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/surajjha101/top-youtube-channels-data).

## 0.2 Dataset Features
This Kaggle dataset contains 1000 records of data on Youtube channels and their stats. The fields include:
- rank: rank of the channel according to the number of subscribers they have
- Youtuber: official name of the channel
- subscribers: number of subscribers the channel has
- video views: number of views across all videos, collectively
- video count: number of videos the channel has uploaded so far
- category: the category (genre) of the channel
- started: the year the channel was started
